<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Grand Junction CO</h3>
<p>To minimize the need of gas line repair, it is essential to comprehend the common reasons for gas leaks. Indoor gas leakages from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning devices take place most commonly in the winter. This is due to the fact that homes are not properly ventilated during the cooler months to prevent heat loss. We recommend setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to signal you of any potential gas leakages if you haven't done so already.</p>
<p>All backflow preventers need to be checked every year and after repair, moving, or replacement by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester (BAT).

These heaters typically last more than 20 years.</p>
