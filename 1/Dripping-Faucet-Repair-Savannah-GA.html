An authorization is not required for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drainpipe or drywell.</p>
