<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
