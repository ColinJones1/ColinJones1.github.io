<p>In addition to the garbage disposal system, there are a number of upgrades and parts that you might need to take into consideration when weighing the waste disposal unit installation cost. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is typical in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
