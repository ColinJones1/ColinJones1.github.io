For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
