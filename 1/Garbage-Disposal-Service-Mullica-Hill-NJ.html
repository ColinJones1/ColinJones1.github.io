Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>When the data collected from the field test shows the assembly has degraded in its performance below the established minimum basic, backflow preventers need to only be fixed. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still prevent backflow.
