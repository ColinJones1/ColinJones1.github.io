<p>Water firmness is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term firmness" originated from ... it's hard to clean in.</p>
<p>A lot of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition security. As the outer finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
