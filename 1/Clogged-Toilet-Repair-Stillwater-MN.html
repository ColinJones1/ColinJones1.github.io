<p>Backflow preventers are vital for developing a safe water system system. No matter which model you pick, all water softeners need to be appropriately maintained. The brine service must be mixed and saved in the brine tank. Regular blocking of the resin likewise needs unique attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, typical backwashing with water will fix this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Also, bacteria and fungi also form mats in the resin that reduce its efficiency. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these problems.
