Well, we still recommend you have a backflow preventer set up anywhere incoming water and wastewater might be cross-connected.</p>
<p>As soon as the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
