Drip Leg - Any dust or grit in the gas line falls under this brief area of pipe before it can reach the hot water heater's control valve. The needed length of the drip leg differs.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
