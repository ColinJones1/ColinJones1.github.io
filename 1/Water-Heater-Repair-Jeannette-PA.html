That's not very much salt, but for those on a strict sodium-free diet plan it might be too much. If this doesn't work, you may need to replace one of your toilet's elements, generally the flapper. There may also be a problem with the chain attached to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can easily replace these parts.</p>

<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most common and terrible water problems: tough water.  Hard water wreaks havoc on the modern house. Scale builds up in your pipes, blocking them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale considerably shortens the life-span of devices like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice makers. Hard water destroys hot water devices. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and harden into solid deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>

<p>After arriving after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together however claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it leaked now since of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was put together. After they offered me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, considering that I never want to see this company once again.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the offender. However not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger problem too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
