<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most apparent indications of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple problem such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent major damage to your house. Even if the issue stems with the community system, it's still smart to bring in the experts to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are primarily time associated. If everything is prepared, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be customized, changed, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and for that reason the total expenses. The majority of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
<p>Your disposer might feature a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the standard plumber's putty as described listed below. Both will produce an excellent seal (though the gasket may lead to small amounts of water collecting around the flange), and what's used is largely a matter of choice. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
