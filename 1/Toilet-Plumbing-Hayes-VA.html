<p>If your water heater has actually required several repairs over the last couple of years, it may be time to get it replaced. A great general rule for water heaters is this: due to the fact that the lifespan of the average hot water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
