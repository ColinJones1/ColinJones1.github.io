<p>Insert the flange on the top of the sink, and attach the attachment system on the underside (Image 1). It is handy to use pressure on the flange from above utilizing a second set of hands or a heavy things. This will keep the flange in place while attaching the fastening system below.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
