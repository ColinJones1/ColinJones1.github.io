<p>Check the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust only in your hot water. If you've never ever done this on your own, you may need a professional to do this. The rust is most likely coming from the inside of your water heater if the anode rod is rusted out. If this is the case, replace your water heater as soon as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you most likely have worn away piping.</p>
