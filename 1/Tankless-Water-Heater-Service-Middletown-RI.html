<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water rather than building up on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the buildup could still occur.</p>
