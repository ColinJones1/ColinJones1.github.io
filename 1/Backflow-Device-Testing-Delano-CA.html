<p>If these combinations aren't effective in unclogging your sink, grab a typical household plunger. If you have a double sink, first seal off the second side with a damp cloth or a stopper. You'll need to develop a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you mean to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger. Location the plunger firmly over the drain and plunge vigorously a number of times. Eliminate the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water when you hear the suction clear the clog.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
