<p>The Battelle Research study also found tough water to rapidly result in clogged shower heads, in many cases after as low as a year and a half of regular use. After just one week of consistent testing with hard water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles became clogged, according to lab results. Shower heads utilizing water dealt with by a water softening system, meanwhile, carried out almost as well as on the day they were set up.</p>
<p>To avoid these things from obstructing your drains and triggering damage, Larry & Sons suggests that you use hair and food stoppers throughout your house. These nifty additions to your sinks and tubs can reduce the amount of hair and food scraps that wind up in your drainpipes. Many garbage disposals will need a brand-new sink drain flange, which includes the metal disk at the drain entryway at the bottom of the sink in addition to a brief length of pipe that extends listed below the sink, where the drain attaches.</p>
