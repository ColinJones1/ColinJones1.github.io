<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Bethpage NY</h3>
<p>Backflow is dangerous due to the fact that it can pollute the public drinking supply with pollutants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and damaging chemicals. In 2010, for example, trainees at a Bowling Green, Kentucky elementary school suffered nausea and other signs after a contractor working on the HEATING AND COOLING system triggered the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
