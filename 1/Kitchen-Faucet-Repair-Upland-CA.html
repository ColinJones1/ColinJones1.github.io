To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace.
