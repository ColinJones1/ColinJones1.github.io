<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.

An aircraft hangar will need an extremely different fire protection system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these 2 examples would likewise vary significantly.</p>
