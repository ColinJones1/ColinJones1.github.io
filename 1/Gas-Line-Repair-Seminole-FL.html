<p>The law likewise requires annual testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report submitted to the DEP. Failure to comply can result in penalties and termination of water service. Due to the fact that backflow preventer gadgets are comprised of moving seals, springs, and parts and are subject to destructive compounds, wear, and fatigue, it's critical to effectively maintain them to ensure they correctly run and play their part in keeping our city's drinking water safe.</p>
