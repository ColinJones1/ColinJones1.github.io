<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX.

Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these problems.</p>
