Call Principle Plumbing, Heating & Cooling and speak with our plumbing installers in Ames, IA to establish a visit to see if whole-house repiping is the best option for your home's plumbing concerns. Water softening means broadening the life expectancy of household machine, such as laundry makers, and the life span of pipelines. It also adds to the enhanced working, and longer lifespan of solar heating unit, cooling units and many other water-based applications.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
