A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may likewise be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration procedures. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely split and merely requires to be changed.</p>

In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
