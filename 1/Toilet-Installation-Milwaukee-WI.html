<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first shot using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A lot of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the proper precautions.</p>
<p>A lot of softeners have actually a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to provide some sort of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's wise to build one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to maintain the unit.</p>
