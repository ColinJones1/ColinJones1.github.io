<p>Vacuum Breakers and Dual Examine Valves are considered non-testable" and might be set up or changed by a house owner. After our plumber completes the deal with your toilet, we'll send you a quick survey where you can let us understand how we did. If you're not 100% pleased with our service, let us know and we'll make it right. For security functions, please inform the Backflow Section of any changes that may require backflow protection.</p>
<p>Two designs of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker.

It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. A PVB might be used to separate health or non-health hazards but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>
