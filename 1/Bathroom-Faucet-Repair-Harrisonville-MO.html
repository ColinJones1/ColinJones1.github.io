<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Harrisonville MO</h3>
<p>Our licensed plumbing technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by hooking up a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank should be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may provide a fast fix in the short term, it can cause much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. A good place to begin looking for the leaking kitchen sink plumbing unit is underneath the puddle of water or where you appear to feel the dampness most.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

Whether it's your kitchen sink, bathroom sink, or a sink in your utility room, we'll evaluate the issue and discover an option.</p>
