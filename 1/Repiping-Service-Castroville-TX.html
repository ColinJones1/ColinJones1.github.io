<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct result on your safety, benefit, convenience, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is extremely important! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system. Present guidelines restrict the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide two types of water treatment systems for difficult water: Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>Understand that softened water contains trace amounts of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water includes about the very same amount of salt as a slice of bread. That's not very much salt, but for those on a strict sodium-free diet plan it might be excessive. If this doesn't work, you might need to replace one of your toilet's elements, generally the flapper. There might also be a concern with the chain connected to the flapper or the float ball. A plumber can easily replace these parts.</p>
