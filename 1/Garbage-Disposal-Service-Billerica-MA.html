<p>Maintenance or replacement, you can anticipate professional service from competent plumbing specialists when you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater repair.

<p>Back-siphonage is backflow triggered by an unfavorable pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a Public water system or customer's safe and clean water system.

That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a dye test.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent guy. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as promised. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
