<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer units do not come with a power cable attached. If this is the case, eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1). Make certain to purchase a wiring kit with the proper power rating and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). When you connect the circuitry harness to the disposer, make sure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord.</p>
<p>We had an excellent experience with Joe Boyette, he was extremely professional, polite, competent. We had a great deal of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month period. We likewise needed to replace a bathroom and a water heater unrelated to the fire, but we felt great in Joe's abilities. We decided to stick with Joe, although we felt Mr Rooter costs were certainly on the high-end. This being published by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
