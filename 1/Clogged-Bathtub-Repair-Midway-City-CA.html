Blanc also constructed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television.

This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
