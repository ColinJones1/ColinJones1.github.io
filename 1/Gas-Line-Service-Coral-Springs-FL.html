Both deserve thinking about for your kitchen, but those benefits are just offered to those who purchase quality units that are also set up by a professional plumber. Too often we see disposal systems destroyed by inappropriate installation. Taking a shortcut by installing it yourself can often cause an absence of efficiency and frequent repairs down the line.</p>
