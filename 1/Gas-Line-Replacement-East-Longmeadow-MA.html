<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is comprised of 6 State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, one of which is also serves as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Plan Examiner for the group. There are few instances when plumbing inspections are mandatory, but the biggest exceptions are building and house updates. If you decide to handle a bathroom remodel (for example), you'll need to set up a minimum of two evaluations, including a rough-in inspection of the new piping and a last examination before linking your home appliances.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on.

<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the structure envelope consisting of below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a sub-system, system, or component  group is replaced, an authorization and inspection shall not be needed.

Call Baker Brothers Plumbing for the fastest and most reliable plumbers for your house or business.

<p>A minimum of once every 3 months, drain water from the tank. Over time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper performance, and draining pipes a gallon or two assists remove the sediment. If you identify a leak and choose a patching job instead of a repiping job, simply remember that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the same material and they may be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to think about repiping your whole house when you spot a leak.</p>
