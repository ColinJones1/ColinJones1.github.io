Depending on the water source, you may need to filter turbid water or decontaminate bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening unit. Lastly, if you own a septic system, you ought to think about the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regrowth cycle. This might or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and performs routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies.
