<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health threat if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for effectiveness, as well as checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
