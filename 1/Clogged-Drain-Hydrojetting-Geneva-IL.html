<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Geneva IL</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
