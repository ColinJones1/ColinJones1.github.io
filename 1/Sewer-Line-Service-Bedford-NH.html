<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most apparent signs of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be).

Even if the issue comes from with the community system, it's still clever to bring in the specialists to limit the damage to your home.</p>
