<p>A lot of residential homes have roofing gutters that stream into downspout drains that direct water far from the house. When those downspouts are connected to underground drains that flow to municipal storm drains or street seamless gutters, they in some cases become clogged with tree roots and particles. These types of obstructions cause seamless gutters to overflow and the weight of the water can trigger rain gutters to pull away from a house while inflicting water damage and rot to the structure. Please note that Roto-Rooter does not clean roofing rain gutters or rectangle-shaped aluminum seamless gutter downspouts.</p>
