<p>Backflow preventers are critical for developing a safe supply of water system. No matter which design you choose, all water softeners need to be properly preserved. The brine option should be mixed and stored in the brine tank. Routine blocking of the resin likewise requires unique attention. For example, if the raw water system is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, regular backwashing with water will resolve this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the material. Similarly, germs and fungis likewise form mats in the resin that decrease its efficiency. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or occasionally cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these nuisances.
