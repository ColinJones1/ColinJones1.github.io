<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in New Braunfels TX</h3>
<p>For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Due to the fact that pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines. Although an EcoWater dealer does not support your area presently, we are happy to assist you with an alternative service. You can order, with complimentary shipping, a leading name-brand filtration or softener system by shopping at Any installation services listed below can then help with installation, or you can simply install the system yourself.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
