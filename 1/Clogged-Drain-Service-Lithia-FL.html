<p>After showing up after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but declared they would not take duty if it leaked now since of some unspecified oddities in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, since I never ever want to see this company once again.</p>
