<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
