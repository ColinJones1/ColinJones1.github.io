Bonney's expert plumbers can rapidly retrofit your sink and install a new instant warm water heater together with a stylish instant hot water faucet to match your kitchen design. 2 From below, put the gaskets and washers according to the manufacturer's directions. Slip the installing ring onto the flange then slide on the snap ring up until it snaps into location. Equally tighten up the three installing bolts, sealing the flange firmly versus the sink.
