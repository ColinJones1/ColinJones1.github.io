<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Wrightsville PA</h3>
<p>Older plumbing systems may have pipes that wear away with time, causing leaks or other problems. Additionally, rust or other buildups in the pipes can restrict air flow and make it difficult to use one or more of your gas-powered devices like the clothing dryer or stove. Based upon research performed by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Benefits Research Study, 2011.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
