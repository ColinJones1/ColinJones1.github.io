<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has frequently been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process.

The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers individual choice not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
