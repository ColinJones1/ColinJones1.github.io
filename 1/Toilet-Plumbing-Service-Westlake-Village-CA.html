<p>If these combinations aren't successful in unclogging your sink, reach for a typical household plunger. If you have a double sink, first seal the second side with a wet cloth or a stopper.

On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you more than likely have actually rusted piping.</p>
