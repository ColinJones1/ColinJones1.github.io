<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
