<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were extremely responsive and prompt to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were very professional and did an incredible task. I would definitely call them once again for my plumbing needs.

This is obviously still a problem that requires to be dealt with right away (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) however not one that requires repiping.</p>
