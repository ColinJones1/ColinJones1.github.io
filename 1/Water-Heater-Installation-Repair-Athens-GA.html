<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Athens GA</h3>
<p>In some cases called an auger, this useful tool can clear clogs that may be stuck further down the system. You'll have to take apart the drainpipe and P-trap that runs below the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that takes a trip behind the cabinet wall. This is where you place the snake into the pipe until you feel resistance to separate the clog.</p>
<p>For gas lines that should be run under ground, an unique type of black pipe should be utilized that is coated with a special plastic material that keeps the wetness out. This is so it is easily discernible from underground water lines, and likewise due to the fact that the plastic coating actually safeguards the pipe much better than a galvanized coating would.</p>
