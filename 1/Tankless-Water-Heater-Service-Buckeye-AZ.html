<p>You have most likely seen drain cleaner products on the shelves at your local home improvement store, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining water like it should, you might be lured to head down there and pick some up to fix it by yourself. These items, after all, make the process seem pretty easy. Regrettably it's not as simple as you might think, and those products are not necessarily going to fix the issue.

Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
