I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.
