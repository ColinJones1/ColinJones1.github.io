<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Franklin TN</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains significant quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of desired usages around your home.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier in the article, carbon monoxide gas is colorless and completely odor free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house should have carbon monoxide detectors set up at the correct areas. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are typically offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new installations should have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
