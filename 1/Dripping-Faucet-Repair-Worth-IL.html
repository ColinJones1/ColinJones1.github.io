<p>When deciding on the correct system protection there are several considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world.

Fire security system are developed to match the threat that exists in the locations they are installed in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be really various, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be created and installed to meet that specific danger or need. An aircraft hangar will need a really different fire security system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would also differ considerably.</p>
