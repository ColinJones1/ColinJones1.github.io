<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Rensselaer IN</h3>
<p>On average, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or in between $130 and $310 to have professional repairs done by a plumber. The per hour charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not include parts or products. Prices depend upon the precise repair needed, where you live, working with a plumber vs. hiring a handyman, and whether you can DIY it.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
