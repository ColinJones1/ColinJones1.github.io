<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
