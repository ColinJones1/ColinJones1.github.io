<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
