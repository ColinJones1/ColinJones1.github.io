Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
