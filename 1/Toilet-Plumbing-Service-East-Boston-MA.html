<p>Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of reasons, consisting of poor soil conditions, clogs from grease and grime, and rust. Even trees and bushes can cause problems for sewer lines, especially in older communities where clay pipe may have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be two times as intensified if pipes have been permitted to freeze.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
