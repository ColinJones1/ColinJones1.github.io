<p>The most reliable method to address tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions.

<p>When the information collected from the field test indicates the assembly has deteriorated in its performance listed below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers need to just be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer.

These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
