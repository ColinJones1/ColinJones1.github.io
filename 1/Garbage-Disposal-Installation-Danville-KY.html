<p>Electric hot water heater do have a few disadvantages nevertheless that deserve explaining. First and foremost, electrical energy is not as inexpensive as gas. Some energy companies charge higher rates for electricity throughout peak durations such as extremely early in the early morning and in the evening. Utilizing your heater during these peak durations can increase your power costs. On the hand, gas is low-cost and has a set rate. Another drawback of an electric hot water heater is that they can be pricey to install, specifically when it concerns whole-house tankless systems.</p>
<p>At least when every 3 months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper efficiency, and draining a gallon approximately helps remove the sediment.

To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to consider repiping your entire home when you identify a leak.</p>
