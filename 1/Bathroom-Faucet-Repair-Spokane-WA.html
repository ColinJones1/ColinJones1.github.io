It is handy to apply pressure on the flange from above using a second set of hands or a heavy item. This will keep the flange in place while attaching the fastening system listed below.

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet.
