When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system. Present regulations limit the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We offer two types of water treatment systems for hard water: Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
