<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Dumfries VA</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
