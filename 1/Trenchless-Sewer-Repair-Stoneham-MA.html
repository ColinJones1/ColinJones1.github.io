Extended warranty: The majority of disposals include a minimum of a 1-year guarantee, but if you buy one with a life time warranty (15+ years), it will most likely be more costly. While there's not a precise schedule as to when you ought to repipe your house, you should absolutely look into repiping if they have not been done in 50 years or more-- specifically if you live in an older house built closer to the turn of the last century.</p>

Place a pail beneath the drain pipe to capture any water that leaks out.</p>
