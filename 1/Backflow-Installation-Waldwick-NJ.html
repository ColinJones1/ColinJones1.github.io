<p>If you have actually checked out the paragraph above, you now understand that there numerous mechanical parts within your toilet's tank that enable your toilet to flush the water down the toilet bowl. When these parts end up being worn or break they need to be changed.

<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
