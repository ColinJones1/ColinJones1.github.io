<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Newark NY?</h3>
<p>Corrosion is a complex phenomenon and there are many aspects that speed up rust in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up corrosion Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of deterioration control. Hence, considering all these elements, in addition to arise from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
