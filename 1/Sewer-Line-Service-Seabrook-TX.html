<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the extent of the rot.

Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
