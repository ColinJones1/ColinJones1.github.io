<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close.

<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board advises the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections concerning the administration of Article 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage happens when there is an unfavorable pressure in the water circulation system, which draws the water from a private water system into the general public water system. This can happen at any time, such as throughout a water main break or throughout a big firefighting effort.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health risk if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, as well as checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
