<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Phelan CA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
