<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow direction within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, however how do they work and which styles are best for certain applications? Often the type and installation requirements are defined by environmental policies and local statutes. Local building regulations for example will require a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air space between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any potential siphon prior to it can happen, avoiding contaminating water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complicated and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices set up to prevent backflow range from the fairly easy to the really sophisticated and complicated.</p>
