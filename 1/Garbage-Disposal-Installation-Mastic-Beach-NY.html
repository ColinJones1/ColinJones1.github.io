<p>Drain pipe is not protected using the needed solvent cement (end of the pipe need to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not actually glued in the regular sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is really a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a few seconds.

<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Appropriate care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
