<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product.

Ensure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cable when you link the electrical wiring harness to the disposer.</p>
