That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to use salt pellets in the brine tank, however then install a reverse-osmosis water filter at the kitchen sink. The filter will get rid of salt from the water, which you can utilize for drinking and cooking.
