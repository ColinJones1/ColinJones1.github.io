<p>He dug two holes on either side of the pipe and had the ability to blast the old, broken pipe out while changing it with a new one at the very same time. We did a follow-up call to the property owner several weeks later on, and she reported no excess water in her lawn. Job well done: You don't wish to end up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the job to a certified plumber makes sure a smooth installation process.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I bought individually from the disposal unit. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>A few of the reasons for drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a stopping working garbage disposal, or excessive food being disposed down the drain. We will typically recommend our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ยฎ services, depending on the severity of the circumstance. Provide us a call if your kitchen drain has actually raised water levels, is making gurgling sounds, smells nasty, or is slow to drain.</p>
