<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).

With this approach, you know the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
