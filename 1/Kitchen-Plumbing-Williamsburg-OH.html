<p>The key to the technology is being able to manage both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby eliminating hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
