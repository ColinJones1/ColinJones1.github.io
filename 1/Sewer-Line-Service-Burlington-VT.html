Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
