<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Castle Hayne NC</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer might be required to be found on the water service line, within the structure, or both areas. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a newly installed backflow preventer, the water consumer is needed to have the backflow preventer evaluated on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>Responsibility for installation falls upon the owner of the home or the co-op or condo board. Owners and boards of structures that are released an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer must submit plans with the DEP within thirty days. If the DEP has not received certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being installed within that time, a Notification of Offense will be sent. Lawbreakers will be liable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental protection Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can eventually cause criminal and civil procedures and actions, along with the termination of water service to the structure.</p>
