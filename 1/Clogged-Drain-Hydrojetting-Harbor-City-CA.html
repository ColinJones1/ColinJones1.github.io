<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>When picking a licensed and insured  plumbing contractor is simply an easy phone call away, why risk an insurance claim on a flooded home.

<p>Know that softened water contains trace amounts of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water contains about the same quantity of salt as a piece of bread.
