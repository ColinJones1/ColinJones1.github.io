<p>The majority of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the external finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Older toilets usually utilize 3.5 gallons or more per flush, particularly if they were produced prior to 1994. More recent models only utilize 1.6 gallons per flush while still supplying the very same flushing power. More recent toilet designs are environmentally-friendly and have a double flushing system which only uses 0.9 gallons per flush. Tankless water heaters: These water heaters heat much faster than conventional hot water heater. They also take up less area because they do not need a tank.</p>
