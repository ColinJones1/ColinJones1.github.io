<p>Borax beings in the specific same family of water softeners as washing soda. Borax is a precipitating water softener and it includes the exact same disadvantages i.e. skin irritation and build-up. If either of these downsides are unacceptable to you - you'll wish to find what's called a non-precipitating water softener. Switch on the water to fill the toilet tank.

<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't installed correctly, you may experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>

They were really responsive and timely to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were extremely professional and did an awesome task. I would definitely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still an issue that needs to be dealt with right now (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) however not one that requires repiping.</p>
