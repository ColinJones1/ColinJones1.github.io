If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that removes sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and controls air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will typically need to be changed instead of fixed. If your pipes are gurgling or releasing foul odors, you'll know this.</p>

However, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, pool, water feature or other kind of cross connection, have actually an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
