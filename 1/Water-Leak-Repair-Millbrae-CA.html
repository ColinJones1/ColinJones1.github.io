<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>The system has actually gone back to a zero demand condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, debris between the # 1 Inspect Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is preventing the # 1 Inspect from closing all the method. This permits pressure to match in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Reduced Pressure. When this takes place, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
