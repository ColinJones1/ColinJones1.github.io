<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
