<p>Both irrigation water and clean water systems are at high danger of entering into contact with pollutants due to backflows. Many faucets can have a low-flow aerator installed at the outlet end of the water spout. Aerators are developed to manage water flow from faucets by presenting air into the water as it streams from the spout. Adding air in this method preserves constant water pressure, which causes the component to use less water.</p>
