<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
