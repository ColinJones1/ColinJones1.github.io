<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can try dumping a tray of ice down the drain, and then turn on the garbage disposal while running water. This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or worn out, broken sink? No problem is undue for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our experienced plumbing team gets the job done quickly and cost effectively.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug set that I purchased individually from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>A malfunctioning garbage disposal can be a major trouble and can cause more severe problems if it is not addressed quickly. If food is still lodged in the system it will not only produce an unpleasant odor in your kitchen, but it can likewise lead to health related problems if not cleared away. Services like restaurants or significant hotels that depend on a fully functioning garage disposal will also suffer if the circumstance is not properly attended to. It is likewise crucial to keep in mind that you must never attempt waste disposal unit repair on your own, as it could result in harmful and possibly deadly consequences.</p>
