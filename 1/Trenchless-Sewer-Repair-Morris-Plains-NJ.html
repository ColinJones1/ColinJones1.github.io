As building types and contents of these structures can be very various, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be designed and installed to satisfy that particular danger or need. An aircraft garage will need a really various fire defense system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would also vary considerably.</p>
