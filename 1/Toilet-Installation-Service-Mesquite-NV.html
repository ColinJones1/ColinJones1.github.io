Increased defense is likewise required when chemicals are contributed to a fire defense system provided by a safe and clean supply of water. If you have kids, remind them to avoid holding on any visible pipelines or having fun with the outdoor gas meter. Holding on a pipeline may trigger it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly accessible in an emergency.</p>
