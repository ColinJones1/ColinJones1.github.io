<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
