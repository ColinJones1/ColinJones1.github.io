It must also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just secure against back siphonage.</p>
