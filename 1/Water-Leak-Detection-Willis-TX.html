<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing regular and major leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can actually be the less expensive and much better long-term option if you do have frequent leakages.</p>

<p>Galvanized water piping rusts and corrodes internally. When drawing water from galvanized pipes, particles of rust, zinc, and other impurities circulation into your drinking water. These pollutants also clog the pipe internally stopping the circulation of water to fixtures. After we evaluate the drains and water system lines and clean up the area, your new sink will be prepared to use!
