If you have two meters, potable and watering, you are also required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
