<h3>Water Heater Repair Services at New Hartford NY</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains considerable amounts of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its numerous designated uses around your home.</p>
