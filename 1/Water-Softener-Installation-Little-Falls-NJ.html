<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can purchase models with unique features that do everything but add the salt, you will pay for each extra feature. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm warranty that the special function will not stop working. Depending on the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or sanitize bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening system. Finally, if you own a septic system, you ought to think about the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regeneration cycle. This might or might not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is common in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
