<p>The next step we need to perform in the repair process, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or particles. This can be tricky, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be used to assure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
<p>If you get your water from a community water supply, check to see if your community currently softens the water.

You'll need to remove your waste disposal unit initially if you currently have an old one set up.</p>
<p>Constantly be sure to thoroughly check out the installation instructions for your specific system before getting to work: while many disposers are installed in the same standard way, your design may have important and special steps not covered in a summary like this.
