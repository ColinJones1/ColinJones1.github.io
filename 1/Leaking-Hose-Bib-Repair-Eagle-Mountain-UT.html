<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Eagle Mountain UT</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to resolve hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to bring back and enter the valve pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
