Water pressure might be or fail lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
