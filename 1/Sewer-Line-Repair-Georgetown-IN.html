<p>The simplest method to keep you and your household safe from the prospective threats of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the very first place. However, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, pool, water feature or other type of cross connection, have an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have kids, you might not want to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and identify the reason for the problem. The line was plainly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
