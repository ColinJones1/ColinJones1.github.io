<p>Backflow preventers need to only be repaired when the information collected from the field test indicates the assembly has actually broken down in its efficiency below the developed minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if essential, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
