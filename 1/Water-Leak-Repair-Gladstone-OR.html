<p>If you need a water softener is a personal preference, determining. An authorization is not needed for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A normal water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
<p>If there is backflow at your house, you could pollute your drinking water with non-treated water from an irrigation canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it.
