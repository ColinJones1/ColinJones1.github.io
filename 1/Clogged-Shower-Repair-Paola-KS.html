<p>After showing up after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it dripped now since of some undefined quirks in how my sink was created. After they offered me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, because I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
<p>As mentioned, clogged or blocked drains and pipes can cause damage to your house. Not only can unclean pipes trigger your water to drain gradually, however it can likewise cause pipes to burst and septic system back-ups. Ensure you do not have a plumbing disaster and make certain your pipes are clean. 1. Get rid of the garbage disposer and disconnect all the old traps and drain lines from below the sink.</p>
