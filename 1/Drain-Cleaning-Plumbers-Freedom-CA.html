<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly.
