For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate rust Likewise, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of deterioration control. Therefore, thinking about all these elements, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
