And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, ensuring your trip lever is working well can save you the trouble of those little everyday hassles - that most people simply deal with and never ever understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water squandered every day by a poor seal.</p>
