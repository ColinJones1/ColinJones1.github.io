<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
