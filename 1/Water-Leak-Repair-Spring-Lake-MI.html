<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at Spring Lake MI</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
