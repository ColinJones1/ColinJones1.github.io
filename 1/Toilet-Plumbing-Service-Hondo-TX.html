For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that accelerate deterioration Likewise, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of corrosion control. Hence, considering all these elements, along with results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
