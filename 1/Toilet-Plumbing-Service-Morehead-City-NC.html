These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
