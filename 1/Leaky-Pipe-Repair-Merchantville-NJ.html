<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
