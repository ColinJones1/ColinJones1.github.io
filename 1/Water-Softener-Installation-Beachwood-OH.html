<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
