<p>We carry the complete selection of Backflow prevention options. So which should you use? The plumbers at Clarke & Rush are experts in repipe jobs, and qualified to help you make this important decision. We will guarantee you understand your choices, the drawbacks and benefits, and make a recommendation so you can make an informed option. A garbage disposal typically plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink. If an outlet like this isn't readily available under your sink, you'll need to have an electrical contractor install one.</p>

Softening your water down to the optimum level of 6 grains of solidity is perfect for household usage because the water remains less corrosive than over-softened water and is without scale producing solidity.

If required, disconnect the disposal from the dishwasher connection. Louisville has a few of the hardest water in the nation, so it is necessary to think about including a water softener to your house.
