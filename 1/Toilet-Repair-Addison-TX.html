The backflow preventer may be required to be located on the water service line, within the structure, or both areas. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a freshly installed backflow preventer, the water client is needed to have the backflow preventer evaluated on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>For RPZ devices, drainage capacity will be sized to accommodate both periodic discharges and a catastrophic failure of the relief valve. Describe manufacturers circulation curves to figure out optimal discharge rate based upon supply pressure or on-site pressure; whichever is higher.
