<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were very responsive and timely to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were really professional and did an awesome task. I would certainly call them once again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still a problem that needs to be dealt with right now (you'll likely need a brand-new water heater) however not one that requires repiping.</p>
