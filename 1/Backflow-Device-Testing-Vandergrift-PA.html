<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the reason for the issue. The line was clearly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
