<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mainly time associated. If everything is all set, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours needed and therefore the total costs. Many plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
