<p>Will not drain - The unit might not be chopping food correctly and waste might have clogged the drain pipe. However, if there are numerous leaks within the system, or if there is evidence of corrosion in several locations, it is probably time to repipe. A water softener is loaded with resin beads. Tough water with calcium and magnesium streams through this resin and, in a process called ion exchange, the firmness ions in the water trade locations with soft ions on the resin beads. The result is soft water.</p>
<p>For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger corrosion that obstructs the line.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low salt diet plans.

Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
