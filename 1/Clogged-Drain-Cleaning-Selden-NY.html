Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get an estimate from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of business we called would provide a price quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the scenario before dedicating to a rate, and all wanted to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
