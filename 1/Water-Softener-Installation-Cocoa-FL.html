<p>Water softeners come in all sizes and shapes and bigger certainly does not suggest much better. WaterBoss ® utilizes fine mesh resin - smaller beads that actually supply more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable optimal capacity in a minimum of area. Plus, our patented Directional Circulation Screen system helps ensure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also protect the resin bed, so we do not need to squander space on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that allow a churning of resin during regeneration to launch dirt, sediment and firmness.</p>
<p>Worse yet ... you arrive home after a great evening out just to find your house or garage is flooded since from your water heater leaking. Master plumbers shall not enable any apprentice plumber, or unlicensed journeyman plumber, in their utilize or otherwise under their supervision, to do plumbing work of any kind, including repairs and clearing stoppages of drains, unless said master plumber is physically present and taking an active part in said work.</p>
