Like any house appliance, a toilet tank includes many small moving parts that might need changed with use gradually. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and cause toilet leaks that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
