<p>Daily usage ought to not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the unit in a steady and safe place.

If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you must wait up until after the cycle is finished and after that checked the system for fractures or broken fittings.

A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
