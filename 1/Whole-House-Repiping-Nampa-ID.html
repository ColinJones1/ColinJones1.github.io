When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated effectively.

A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely split and just requires to be replaced.</p>
