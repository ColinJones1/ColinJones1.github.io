<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
