I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
