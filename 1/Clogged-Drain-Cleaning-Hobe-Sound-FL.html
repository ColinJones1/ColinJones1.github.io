<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are many factors that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up corrosion Likewise, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of rust control.
