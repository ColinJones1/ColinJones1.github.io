Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
