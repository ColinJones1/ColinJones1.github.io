<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely used in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
