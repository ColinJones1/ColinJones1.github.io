<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is normal in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can attain this.</p>
