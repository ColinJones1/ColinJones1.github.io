<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is normal in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
