<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
