<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, in addition to examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
