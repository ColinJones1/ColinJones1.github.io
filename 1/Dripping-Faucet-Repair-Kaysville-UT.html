<p>The main media included within a water softener is referred to as ion exchange resin. This resin is essentially an insoluble matrix usually in the shape of little (1-2 mm diameter) beads. The material has extremely established structure of pores on the surface area of which are sites with quickly caught and launched ions.

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
