<p>SofTap's water softening technology is well-suited for household, commercial, and industrial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale accumulation in homes and scaling in commercial water treatment systems, along with improving present reverse osmosis treatment systems. The innovation is easier and more economical than other softening systems on the market today that utilize zeolites, which must be restored using brine, or membrane nanofiltration that needs substantial water use and high pressure.</p>
<p>Plumbing is the practice, products and fixtures used in the installation, maintenance, extension, and change of all piping, fixtures, plumbing devices, and plumbing appurtenances in connection with hygienic drainage or storm drainage centers; venting systems and private or public water system systems, within or adjacent to any building or structure.</p>

<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
