<p>Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water coming from your water devices? This is a good indicator that your pipes may be rusting from the within and therefore, need to be replaced.

New meters need to meet regulations and code requirements for their placement, and gas suppliers may require a special meter for their services, restricting your choices. Layout - Once you include a 2nd floor and even third floor, pipes need to be run up to it. This is more complex than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor intensive.
