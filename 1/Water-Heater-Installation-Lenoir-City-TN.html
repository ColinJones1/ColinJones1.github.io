<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
