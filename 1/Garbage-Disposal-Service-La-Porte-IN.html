<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is typical in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
