Owners and boards of structures that are issued an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to submit plans with the DEP within 1 month. If the DEP has actually not gotten certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being installed within that time, a Notice of Violation will be sent out. Violators will be accountable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental Control Board (ECB).
