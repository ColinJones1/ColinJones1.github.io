<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually often been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening merely eliminates hardness minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not need. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition defense. As the external finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If allowed to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the infected water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, as well as checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
