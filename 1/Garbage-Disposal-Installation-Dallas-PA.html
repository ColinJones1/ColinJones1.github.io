<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. An action crew is offered for initial investigation of sewer emergency situations every day of the year. Call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700 if sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks. City workers will examine and eliminate obstructions in the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line that the City is responsible for. You may have to wait until the storm has diminished to have the backup solved if the issue is the outcome of too much storm water in the system.</p>
<p>It's a great concept to have a professional assess your drain system if you experience clogs and backups in your house more than a couple of times. A drain specialist like TLC will utilize a camera to examine your drain system. Frequently, if you have multiple drain problems you may have a drain line break somewhere in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can determine the problem and locate so the drain can be fixed.</p>
<p>When a leak develops under the structure of your residential or commercial property or in walls behind vanities and bathtubs it is typically a much better option to merely replace the whole broken water system. At Rainaldi, we are experts in repiping. We've successfully repiped thousands of Central Florida properties with very little disruption, and desire you to understand that no task is too huge, or too little. We understand the damage and frustration a leak can cause, please ask us about water extraction and remediation services.</p>

Repiping a home can either be a complete redo job where the entire home's plumbing system is repiped (from the kitchen to the bathroom and from the water supply line to drain lives). Or it can be a much simpler job where a single piece of pipe is switched out with a new one.</p>
