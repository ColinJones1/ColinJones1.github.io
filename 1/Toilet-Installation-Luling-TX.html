<p>Obligation for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the property or apartment board. Owners and boards of structures that are released an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to file strategies with the DEP within 1 month. If the DEP has actually not gotten accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the procedure of being set up within that time, a Notification of Infraction will be sent. Lawbreakers will be responsible for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental Control Board (ECB).
