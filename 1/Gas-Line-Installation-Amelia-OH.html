For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that accelerate deterioration Likewise, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of corrosion control. Hence, considering all these elements, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
