<p>Many houses or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the external finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
