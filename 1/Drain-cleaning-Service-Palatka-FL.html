<p>Nevertheless, UPC model code requires stand-alone residential systems utilizing non-potable piping materials to achieve the very same level of defense as a commercial system. When chemicals are included to a fire defense system supplied by a safe and clean water supply, increased security is also needed. If you have children, remind them to prevent hanging on any noticeable pipelines or having fun with the outdoor gas meter. Holding on a pipeline may trigger it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter ought to be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is easily accessible in an emergency.</p>
