<p>Pipeline video inspection is a type of telepresence used to aesthetically check the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A typical application is for a plumber to identify the condition of small diameter sewer lines and household connection drain pipes. With special root nozzles, we can clean and clear most of the roots, rust, and debris to prepare the line for possible CIPP lining reinstatement if the pipe requires to be fixed. The water pressure in the hydro jetting procedure can be managed to accommodate specific drains like kitchen sinks, floor drains, storm or drain systems, and main sewer lines.
