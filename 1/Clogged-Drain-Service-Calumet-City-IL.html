When working with a double bowl kitchen sink, stuff the other opening with a rag, which helps use extra pressure to the clog. For blockages that happen even more down the pipe, use a cable television auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made from long, versatile steel cable television injury around a spindle with a hand crank.

I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â€² hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
