<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the structure envelope consisting of listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a component, system, or sub-system  group is replaced, a permit and inspection shall not be needed. This shall not prevent the licensee from getting licenses and inspections for such work if so preferred.</p>
<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board recommends the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections concerning the administration of Short article 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, consisting of licensing. Backsiphonage takes place when there is an unfavorable pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a personal water system into the public water system.

<p>Your disposer may feature a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as detailed listed below. Both will create an excellent seal (though the gasket may result in small amounts of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is mainly a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
