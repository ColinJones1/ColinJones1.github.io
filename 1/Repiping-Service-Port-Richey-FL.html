Owners and boards of structures that are released an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer must submit plans with the DEP within 1 month. If the DEP has actually not gotten certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notice of Offense will be sent out. Violators will be responsible for a civil charge of up to $1,000 issued by the Environmental Control Board (ECB).
