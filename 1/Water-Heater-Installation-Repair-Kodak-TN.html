In one- and two-family homes, AWWA states that backflow preventers are not needed on lawn sprinkler built of approved potable material and designed to stream water, so it does not stagnate.

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are installed in locations where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
