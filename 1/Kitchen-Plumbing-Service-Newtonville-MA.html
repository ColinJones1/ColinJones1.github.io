It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>

<p>As discussed previously in the article, carbon monoxide is entirely odor free and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every home should have carbon monoxide gas detectors set up at the proper places.

They are normally sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all new setups should have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
