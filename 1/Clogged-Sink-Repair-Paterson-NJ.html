These pipes are mostly in production, commercial, and industrial settings. Fitters install and repair pipe systems in power plants, along with heating and cooling systems in big office buildings. Steamfitters concentrate on systems that are developed for the flow of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters may specialize as sprinklerfitters or gasfitters.</p>

It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. A PVB might be used to separate health or non-health threats however is effective versus back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the potable system offering the cosmetics water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems.
