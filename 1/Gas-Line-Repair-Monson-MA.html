I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
