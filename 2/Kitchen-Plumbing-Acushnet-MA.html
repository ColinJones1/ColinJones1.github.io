<p>Improperly set up gas lines lead to gas leaks. Gas leaks are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy job. The gas lines need to be calibrated to the right levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a house, next to cooling and heating. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
<p>If your water heater has needed numerous repairs over the last few years, it might be time to get it changed. A great guideline for hot water heater is this: due to the fact that the life expectancy of the average hot water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
