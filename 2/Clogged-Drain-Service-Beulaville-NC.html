<p>A water softener must be installed as near to the water's point of entry into the house as possible. This guarantees the majority of your plumbing and devices are profiting of carrying the softened water. It's specifically crucial to make certain your water softener is located before your water heater, as tough water does the best damage to hot water home appliances. You will want to install the softener in a dry, level area, like a basement or garage. It will need to be near to the water's main line, an electrical outlet to turn on the system, and a drain for the brine option from the regrowth cycle.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
