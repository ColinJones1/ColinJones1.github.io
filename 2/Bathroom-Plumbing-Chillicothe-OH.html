<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Chillicothe OH</h3>
<p>A malfunctioning waste disposal unit, grease accumulation, accumulated food and more can all add to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the centerpiece in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems. There are a variety of methods homeowners can unclog a kitchen sink, including using a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or using a solution of vinegar and baking soda. For the more serious clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can attempt discarding a tray of ice down the drain, and after that turn on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or tired, worn sink? No problem is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our experienced plumbing group finishes the job quickly and cost effectively.</p>
