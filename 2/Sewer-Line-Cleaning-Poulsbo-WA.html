We offer a range of types of Backflow Preventers, consisting of Lowered Pressure Zone (RPZ) Assemblies, Vacuum Breakers, Double Checks, and Double Check Valve Assemblies, in addition to accompanying test valves, kits, and enclosures.</p>

Sanford & Boy plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. During regeneration, salted water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>

I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
