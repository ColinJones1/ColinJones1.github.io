<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
