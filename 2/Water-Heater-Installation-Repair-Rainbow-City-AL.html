Water pressure may be or stop working minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the structure envelope including below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a fixture, system, or sub-system  group is changed, an authorization and inspection shall not be required.

As the external finishing of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
