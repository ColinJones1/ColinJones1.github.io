<p>Offering quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions likewise allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>You want to save water. Older toilets consume to seven gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than newer designs. U.S. Epa's WaterSense toilets utilize less than 1.6 gallons per flush. Changing your toilet with a new model can conserve thousands of gallons of water - reducing your energy bills and helping the environment.</p>
