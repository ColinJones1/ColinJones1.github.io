<p>In some cases called an auger, this convenient tool can clear clogs that might be stuck even more down the system.

<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
