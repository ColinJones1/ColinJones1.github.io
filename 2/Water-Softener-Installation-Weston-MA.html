<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is typical in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
