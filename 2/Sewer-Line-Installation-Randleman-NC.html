<p>There's a great possibility it's since the garbage disposal is clogged if the sink is no longer draining as rapidly as it once did. Not just can a clogged disposal cause the sink to drain gradually, it can also trigger dirty water to recede into the sink.

Consult makers specifications for recommendations. When searching for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your requirements and ask candidates if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the advanced experience and licenses connected with a plumbing contractor.</p>
