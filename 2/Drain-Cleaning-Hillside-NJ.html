<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to corrode and burst when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one if so. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
