<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
