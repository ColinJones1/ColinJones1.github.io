<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health risk if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, along with checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
