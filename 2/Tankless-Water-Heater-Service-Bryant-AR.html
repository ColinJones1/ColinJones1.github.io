<p>It is highly advised not to try any DIY when is connected to Garbage Disposals installation.

<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>The majority of houses or structures that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the external covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
