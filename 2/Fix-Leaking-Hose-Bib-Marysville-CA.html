<p>Often you understand you have a sewer line break due to the fact that you can smell nasty odors or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is essential to identify the precise location of the break in your sewer line. Often times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can conserve you thousands of dollars in repairs. Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can resolve the problem.

<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
