<p>Our Water Softeners Are Remarkably Designed To Work. Two great advantages of having a disposal system set up are: 1) that it makes clean up around the kitchen much easier, and 2) it considerably reduces the amount of organic waste that you need to dispose of.

<p>Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
