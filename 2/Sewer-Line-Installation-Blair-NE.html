<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally preserved at a significant pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Since of the fundamental style of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an exceptionally low flow or fixed flow condition may trigger annoyance leaking and possible fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve right away ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>
