<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
