<p>Won't drain - The system might not be slicing food properly and waste might have clogged the drain pipe. Nevertheless, if there are a number of leakages within the system, or if there is proof of deterioration in several places, it is probably time to repipe. A water softener is loaded with resin beads. Difficult water with calcium and magnesium streams through this resin and, in a procedure called ion exchange, the hardness ions in the water trade places with soft ions on the resin beads. The result is soft water.</p>

You may have to look into using a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog.

PEX and copper both offer numerous advantages and advantages such as removing the metallic taste from your water.</p>
