<h3>Backflow Prevention Device Testing & Repair in Winder Georgia</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
