<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to prevent backflow. The standard methods of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>Use the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it totally free. Numerous homes in my community being repiped and have spoken with neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Apparently it begins with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause major damage if the leak isn't identified soon.</p>
