<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, however how do they work and which styles are best for certain applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and environmental policies. Local building codes for example will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air space between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any potential siphon before it can take place, avoiding contaminating water from being drawn back into the pipe system.
