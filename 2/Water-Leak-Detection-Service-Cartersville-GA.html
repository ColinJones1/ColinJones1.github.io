<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Cartersville GA</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium.

Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite an annoyance-- for its lots of desired usages around your house.</p>
<p>Even small leaks can cause big repairs. Avoid getting soaked by working with an experienced, licensed pro.
