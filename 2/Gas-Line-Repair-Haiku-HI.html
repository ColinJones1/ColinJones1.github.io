<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Haiku HI</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leaks occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these problems.</p>
