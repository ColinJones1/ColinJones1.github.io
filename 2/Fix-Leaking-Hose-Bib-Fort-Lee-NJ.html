<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is consisted of six State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, among which is also serves as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Plan Examiner for the group. There are few circumstances when plumbing inspections are obligatory, but the largest exceptions are construction and home updates.

While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
