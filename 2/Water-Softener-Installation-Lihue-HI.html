<p>Both irrigation water and clean water supply are at high risk of entering into contact with pollutants due to backflows. Numerous faucets can have a low-flow aerator set up at the outlet end of the water spout.

Including air in this way keeps consistent water pressure, which causes the fixture to utilize less water.</p>

Other laws can require the installation of more advanced and complex backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices set up to prevent backflow range from the reasonably simple to the complex and extremely sophisticated.</p>
