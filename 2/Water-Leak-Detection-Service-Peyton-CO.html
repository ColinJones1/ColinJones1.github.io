<p>IRWD is committed to providing safe, high quality water to clients. Our extensive water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our clients is kept free from damaging contaminants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices including a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination may take place when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating & cooling system, into the safe and clean water supply. This can occur through a procedure known as backflow.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health hazard if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
