<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
