<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. Plumbing problems aren't simply hard to detect, they're likewise capable of triggering some major damage.
