<p>When lime is added to the water, it changes the water chemistry, causing the calcium to come out of the service. The particles of calcium integrate, end up being much heavier than the rest of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment process. Flexible gas lines are generally more suitable to inflexible lines, particularly in areas where earthquakes are more common and for the connection between the supply and device. Flexible gas lines are less most likely to be detached in a natural disaster which decreases the danger of a surge or fire.</p>
