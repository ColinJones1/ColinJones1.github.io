<p>Garbage disposal service warranties last an average of 5 years, but they can range in between 2 and 10 years. Considering that the typical life expectancy of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you might wish to buy a prolonged guarantee. Many service warranties cover the cost to repair and replace normal wear and tear failures. To avoid more malfunctions, homeowners need to stay up to date with regular maintenance of their garbage disposal.</p>
<p>It may be time to get it replaced if your water heater has required several repairs over the last few years. A great rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the life expectancy of the average water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>If the work set up by the authorization holder is authorized by the inspector, the license holder if requested, will get a Certificate of Approval from the plumbing department. You can purchase a disposal that currently has a cord connected if you're not comfortable making electrical connections for your garbage disposal installation. Ask at your house center or device store, or search online for 'waste disposal unit with cable attached.</p>
