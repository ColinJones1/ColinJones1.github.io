I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole.

This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
