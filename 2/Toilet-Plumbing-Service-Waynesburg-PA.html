<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home.

Salt is generally utilized in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
