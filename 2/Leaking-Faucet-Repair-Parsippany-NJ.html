<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and expect the best is normal in our market and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately interacting that you can attain this.</p>
