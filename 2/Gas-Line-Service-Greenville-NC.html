<h3>Leaking Shower in Greenville North Carolina</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of three attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he determined that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the newly cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and perseverance the job was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the issue if this is the case. You might need to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog.

PEX and copper both use various advantages and benefits such as removing the metal taste from your water.</p>
