<p>The best way to identify if your home has hard water is to bring a water sample to a water-testing lab. For about $90 approximately you'll receive a full report, and not almost minerals. The detailed analysis will also note the presence of many other substances, consisting of nitrates, chlorine, sodium, and harmful germs.

<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing provided outstanding service for us in changing a really balky tub spout, and broken toilet parts. Not only was he very professional and comprehensive but he had the ability to respond to all my questions worrying the service. If I could, I would offer 6 stars.
