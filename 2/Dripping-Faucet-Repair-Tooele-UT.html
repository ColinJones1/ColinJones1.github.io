<p>A pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) is thought about a testable backflow preventer, however it is also really uncommon. They were made so as to provide the plumber a testable vacuum breaker device. When it comes to the risk, this device covers hazardous in addition to non-hazardous situations. However simply as with the AVB it can not deal with back pressure, only back siphonage.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
