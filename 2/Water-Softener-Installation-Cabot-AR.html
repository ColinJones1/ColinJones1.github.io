<p>When the data gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has actually degraded in its performance listed below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers should just be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if essential, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This indicates the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
