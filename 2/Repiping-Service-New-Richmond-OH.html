A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a nearby drainpipe or drywell.</p>

There may likewise be a problem with the chain attached to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
