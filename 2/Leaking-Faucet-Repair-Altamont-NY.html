This sediment ultimately gets hard and takes away from the capability of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is heated directly whenever it's needed. Tankless systems particularly use an aspect that warms up water when the tap is switched on. The water is continually warmed as long as the tap stays on. The water stops being heated up if the tap is right away changed off.

Tankless electric water heaters use less power than standard water heaters since they only heat water when needed.</p>
