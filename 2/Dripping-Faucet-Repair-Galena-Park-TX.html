Aesthetically check the shut-off valve of the main water supply for damages and problems. Inspect if the water meter is continuously checking out even if the valve is shut down. If water leaks are present in the property, this would help confirm.</p>
<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't installed appropriately, you might experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in squandered water.</p>
