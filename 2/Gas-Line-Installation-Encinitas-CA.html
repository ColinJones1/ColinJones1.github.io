<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most devastating and prevalent water problems: difficult water.  Hard water ruined the modern house. Scale builds up in your pipes, blocking them and reducing water pressure.  Scale significantly reduces the lifespan of devices like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice machines. Difficult water destroys hot water appliances. The higher the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will strengthen and solidify into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>

<p>To prevent these things from obstructing your drains and causing damage, Larry & Sons recommends that you utilize hair and food stoppers throughout your house. These cool additions to your tubs and sinks can minimize the amount of hair and food scraps that end up in your drainpipes. Numerous garbage disposals will need a new sink drain flange, which includes the metal disk at the drain entryway at the bottom of the sink as well as a short length of pipe that extends below the sink, where the drain connects.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it complimentary. Several houses in my community being repiped and have actually spoken to next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't identified soon, obviously it begins with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can trigger significant damage.</p>
