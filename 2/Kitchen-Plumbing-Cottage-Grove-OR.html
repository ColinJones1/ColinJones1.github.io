Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>

If you have an older house and are experiencing major and frequent leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can really be the more affordable and better long-term option if you do have regular leaks.</p>
