That's not very much salt, however for those on a stringent sodium-free diet plan it might be too much. If this does not work, you may need to replace one of your toilet's parts, usually the flapper. There might also be an issue with the chain attached to the flapper or the float ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
