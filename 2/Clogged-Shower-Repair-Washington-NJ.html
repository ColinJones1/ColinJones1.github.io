The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm warranty that the unique function will not fail. Depending upon the water source, you might need to filter turbid water or sanitize bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit. Finally, if you own a septic system, you need to think about the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates suggest that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regrowth cycle. This might or may not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
