This seal weakens with time enabling water to escape into the toilet bowl, therefore minimizing the quantity of water in the tank offered for a flush.  It likewise has the drawback of increasing your water costs due to wastage of water.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a house is because there is excessive hair in the shower drain.
