With a trademarked chlorine generator, our superior systems also offer an automatic cleaning cycle. The CARIX ® ion exchange process (Co2 Regenerated Ion EXchanger) enables a purposeful partial desalination and therefore softening of drinking water containing high amounts of hardeners, nitrate and sulfate.</p>
<p>Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer shall be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices suggests a DCV assembly on dry or damp sprinkler systems unless there is a danger of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
<p>Backpressure might take place when the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system if these connections are not properly secured.</p>
