<p>There are a number of telltale signs that will let you know you have a gas line leak in your house, and it is important to take notice of them. The gas pipe may be punctured or harmed if you observe a strong odor that looks like rotten eggs. You might also hear a hissing noise as the gas is getting away from the line, but that isn't always the case. It is important to take action quickly to avoid any severe problems and to keep everyone safe if you smell rotten eggs.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the culprit. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger problem too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
