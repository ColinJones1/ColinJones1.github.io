<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. The majority of home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>

Sewer pipes can be notoriously hard to trace, particularly on older properties, so you'll wish to work with someone who will trace the problem at its origin.</p>
