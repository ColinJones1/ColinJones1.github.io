<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Chester VA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Regrettably, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leakages happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these problems.</p>
