<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in various parts of the plumbing system, most commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low circulation issues or perhaps stop a fixture from streaming completely. The next common concern that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it minimizes the offered volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>Water temperature issues can be repaired by adjusting the temperature level on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can simply loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits.
