In some cases, however, the damage is so comprehensive that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is simply a more useful alternative.

<p>Nevertheless, UPC model code requires stand-alone residential systems utilizing non-potable piping products to achieve the very same level of defense as a commercial system.
