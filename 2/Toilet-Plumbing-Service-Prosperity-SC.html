<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
