I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
