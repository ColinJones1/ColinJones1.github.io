<p>Some states need pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they might also require a special license to work on gas lines. Licensing normally requires an exam or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board to find out more. No, but you might have to coordinate with a Vectren agent to get to your residential or commercial property to perform service work, including relighting your natural gas appliances.</p>
