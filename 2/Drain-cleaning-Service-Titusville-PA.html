<p>Many homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away.

As the external covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
