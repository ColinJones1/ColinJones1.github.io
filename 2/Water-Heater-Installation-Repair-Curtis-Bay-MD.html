<p>When picking the proper system protection there are a number of factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on an individual basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler contains the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are created to match the hazard that exists in the areas they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be very different, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation needs to be developed and installed to satisfy that particular danger or need. An airplane hangar will need a really various fire defense system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would also differ greatly.</p>
