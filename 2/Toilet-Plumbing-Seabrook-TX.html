<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be discovered near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets.

<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET used by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.
