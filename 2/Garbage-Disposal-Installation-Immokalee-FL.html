<p>Everyday use need to not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a steady and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing. You must wait until after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration.
