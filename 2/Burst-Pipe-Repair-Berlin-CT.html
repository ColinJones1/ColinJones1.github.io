<p>Inspecting the condition, water, and age lines to the water heater can help plumbers comprehend many things, consisting of water pressure and indications of leakages. It can likely last beyond its basic service warranty if the water heater has been kept with annual flush service. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to potential contamination or poorer quality water, need a backflow prevention device.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a serious public health hazard if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
