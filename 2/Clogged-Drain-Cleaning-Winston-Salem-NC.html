<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Winston Salem NC</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
