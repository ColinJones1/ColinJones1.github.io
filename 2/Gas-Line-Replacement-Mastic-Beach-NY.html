Industrial supply of water typically has a minimum requirement of quality, depending on the industrial procedure in concern. Agriculture on the other hand has less rigid water quality standards. But where backflow preventers are most essential remains in the supply of drinkable water for individual and domestic use.</p>
<p>2 designs of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve.
