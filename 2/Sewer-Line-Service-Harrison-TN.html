<p>Improperly installed gas lines lead to gas leakages. Gas leaks are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself task.

After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the reason for the issue. The line was plainly deteriorating; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
