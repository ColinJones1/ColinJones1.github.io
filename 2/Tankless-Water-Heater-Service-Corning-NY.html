<p>Normally, there are storage tank water heaters that utilize either gas or electrical energy for their fuel. Gas tank systems use almost 50% less energy, costing less to run, than the electric variety. Nevertheless, they cost a bit more than electrical designs. They also feature a temperature and pressure-release valve that opens when either temperature or pressure exceeds pre-programmed levels. We supply gas water heater service, as well as electric hot water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Coast.</p>
