Considering that the hardness minerals have a greater positive charge than the salt, they will knock the sodium ions off and take their location.</p>

<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most apparent signs of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your home. Even if the issue stems with the local system, it's still clever to generate the professionals to restrict the damage to your home.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is normal in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
