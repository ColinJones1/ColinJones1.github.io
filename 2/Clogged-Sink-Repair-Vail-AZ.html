<p>Many homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition security. As the external finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Inspections are required in a lot of states to ensure piping is at the needed depth. For instance, California has rigorous guidelines relating to underground gas line installation because of earthquakes and other natural catastrophes. Piping ought to be at least 18 inches listed below ground for more secure locations and 24 inches for places at greater danger of external damage.</p>
