<p>Once, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but should then shift to galvanized. I am not sure why that must be. It is likewise permitted to use black iron if it is most likely coated with a galvanized coating (which is essentially an unique paint"). PG&E often does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your house. Once the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it should be restored (cleaned up). Salt is generally utilized in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
