<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mostly time associated. If whatever is ready, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and therefore the total expenses. Most plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>
