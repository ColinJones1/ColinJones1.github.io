Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
