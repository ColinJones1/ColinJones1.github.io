Toilet Runs Periodically - Don't you dislike it when the toilet runs 5 minutes after you flushed? It typically implies there is an issue with the flapper, or the toilet is leaking water someplace.</p>
<p>To identify which toilet valve is triggering the problem, look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That slow, consistent outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water spots and deterioration. However do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
