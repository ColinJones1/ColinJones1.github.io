<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. A little cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the brand-new line throughout installation. Fewer parts in the system lead to fewer tankless water heater repair appointments.</p>

Scale does not form in uniform homogeneous layers that would protect pipe from rust Scale can be soft or permeable and is highly irregular. Deterioration can still take place under conditions that are favorable to the formation of hard-water scale and even when hard-water scale is currently present.</p>
