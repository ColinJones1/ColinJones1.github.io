<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic ways of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
