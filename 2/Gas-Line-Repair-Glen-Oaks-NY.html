<p>After showing up after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after among the 2 gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but declared they would not take responsibility if it leaked now because of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was created. After they offered me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, because I never wish to see this company once again.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the offender. However not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with too little slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
