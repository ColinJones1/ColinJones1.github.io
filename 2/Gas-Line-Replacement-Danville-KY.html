During regrowth, salty water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the useful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it totally free. Several houses in my area being repiped and have actually spoken to neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't detected quickly, obviously it begins with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause major damage.</p>
