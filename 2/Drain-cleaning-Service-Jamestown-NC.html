<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be removed and changed with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that just initial factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to use and changing the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>Other pipe repair strategies include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull technique interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the usage of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into location. All brand-new replacement pipes have a forecasted lifespan of one a century and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another reliable technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially gets rid of the need for broken pipe removal. By placing a solidifying lining product which coats the within the existing pipe, a new pipe is produced inside the broken one.</p>
