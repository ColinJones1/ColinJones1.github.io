<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement in Waimanalo HI</h3>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets must definitely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet ought to be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
