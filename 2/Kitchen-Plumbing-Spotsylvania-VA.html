<p>This is the timeless question that lots of property owners ask themselves. Is it better to repair their pipes or repipe them and start fresh? The answer is entirely dependent on your special circumstance. For example, if your pipe is experiencing a little leak but remains in otherwise great condition, we would suggest repairing it. Nevertheless, if the pipe is constantly leaking and needs frequent repairs, we would recommend repiping.

<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that regulates water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't set up properly, you might experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>

<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
