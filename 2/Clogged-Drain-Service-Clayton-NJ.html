That's why Pratt Plumbing receives a lot of phone calls requesting garbage disposal repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>Toilet repair can look deceptively basic when you see a diagram of the working parts. You believe, Sure, I can do that," however checked out the directions thoroughly. For example, the standard directions for toilet tank flush valve replacement consist of, Beware of permanently scratching the flush valve seat", shut off main valve", detach tubes", and take care not to crack the toilet tank."
