<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug set that I purchased individually from the disposal system.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
