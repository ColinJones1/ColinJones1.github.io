<p>If your water heater has needed several repairs over the last couple of years, it might be time to get it replaced. An excellent general rule for water heaters is this: because the life expectancy of the average hot water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
