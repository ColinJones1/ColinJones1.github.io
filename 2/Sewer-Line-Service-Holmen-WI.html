<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; extra, more substantial costs can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for homeowners. If installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help identify.</p>

In some cases it might be needed to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. If the resin becomes fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Cleaners need to be used according to manufacturer guidelines to avoid contamination.</p>
