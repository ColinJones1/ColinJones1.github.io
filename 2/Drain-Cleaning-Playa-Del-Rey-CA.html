A typical water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
<p>Back-siphonage is backflow caused by an unfavorable pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a Public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. The effect resembles drinking water through a straw. Back-siphonage can happen when there is a stoppage of water supply due to close-by fire battling, a break in a water main, etc</p>
