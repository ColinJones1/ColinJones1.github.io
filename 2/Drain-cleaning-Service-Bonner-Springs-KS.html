<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
