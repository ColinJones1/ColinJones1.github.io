In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly.
