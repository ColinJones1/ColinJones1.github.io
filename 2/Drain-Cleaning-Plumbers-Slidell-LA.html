Worms for irrigation systems: Homeowners found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the atmospheric pressure breaker malfunctioned on a privately owned underground lawn sprinkler.

Call your insurance representative and confirm your coverage. Double check with your agent to confirm that your understanding is proper as soon as you have actually checked out through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered.</p>
