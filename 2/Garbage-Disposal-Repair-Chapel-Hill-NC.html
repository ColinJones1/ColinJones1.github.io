<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for developing a safe supply of water system. No matter which design you pick, all water softeners need to be properly maintained. The salt water solution should be combined and kept in the brine tank. Regular clogging of the resin likewise requires special attention.

Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these problems.
