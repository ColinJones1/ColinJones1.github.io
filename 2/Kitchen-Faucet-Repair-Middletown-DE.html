<p>A clogged drain is another common repair - mainly with sinks. In most cases, a sink drain issue is brought on by excessive impurities or particles inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care items or soaps. While there are a number of chemical drain cleaning options, in some cases this can trigger more damage than aid.

<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather condition security. As the outer coating of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>A few of the causes of drain line blockages in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a failing waste disposal unit, or excessive food being disposed down the drain. We will usually suggest our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the severity of the circumstance.
