Chlorinated Polyvinylchloride Piping (CPVC) piping products cost from $0.40 to $1.56 per linear foot. A popular replacement product for metal pipes, CPVC pipe is stiff plastic piping that has thick walls and can be utilized for cold and hot drinking water pipes. CPVC is easy to install and meets the most rigorous building regulations.</p>
<p>A pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) is considered a testable backflow preventer, but it is likewise very uncommon. They were produced so regarding offer the plumber a testable vacuum breaker device.

At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive choice.</p>
