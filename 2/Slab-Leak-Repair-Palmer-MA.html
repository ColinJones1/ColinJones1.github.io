<p>Liners are another popular product sewer cleaners sell nowadays. A liner is a cloth tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin. Company then typically blow the liner into an existing pipe. If your house was built prior to the 1970s or hasn't been redesigned, you will most likely have old pipes that need changing.</p>
<p>If the sink is no longer draining pipes as quickly as it when did, there's a great chance it's due to the fact that the waste disposal unit is clogged.

At the least, it would have been a very costly alternative.</p>
