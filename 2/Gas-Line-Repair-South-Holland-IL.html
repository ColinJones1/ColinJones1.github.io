<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in South Holland IL</h3>
<p>To replace a gas and repair line expect to pay $ 120 to $1,300. Fixing a gas line is actually replacing a gas line - if it's faulty it needs to be changed. The cost of gas line replacement is identified by the cost of labor and materials. The difference of the cost depends upon whether the project is a simple gas leak repair or a complete replacement of the gas line system. Additional gas line installation for new devices are charged independently.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
