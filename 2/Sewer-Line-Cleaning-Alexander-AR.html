If your house was developed before the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and inspect if there are locations that need repiping.

When installed properly, you should not be able to get rid of the cushion mount without considerable extending and pulling, and the mount ring must turn freely around it.</p>
