<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal preference. A license is not required for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or components. A common water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
<p>The most common bathroom sink plumbing issue house owners face is a clogged drain, from the build-up of hair, soap residue, and even foreign objects like bobby pins or cotton bud.
