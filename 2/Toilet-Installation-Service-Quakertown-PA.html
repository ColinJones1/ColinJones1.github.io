<p>After getting here after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but claimed they would not take obligation if it leaked now because of some undefined oddities in how my sink was assembled. After they gave me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, considering that I never want to see this company once again.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the offender. However not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
