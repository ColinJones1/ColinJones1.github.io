<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to get in the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
