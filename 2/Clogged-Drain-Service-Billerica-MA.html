A batch feed waste disposal unit costs more than a continuous-feed disposal but is terrific for putting safety first. It runs in batches and has a cover over the disposal entryway, needing that you put the food into the disposal and then turn a switch to grind the food. Only a handful of types are readily available due to their cost.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it changed if your water heater has needed multiple repairs over the last couple of years. An excellent guideline for hot water heater is this: since the life-span of the typical water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your water heater.</p>
