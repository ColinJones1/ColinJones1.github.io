<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are primarily time associated. If everything is ready, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be customized, changed, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and for that reason the total costs. Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
