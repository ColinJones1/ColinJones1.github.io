Its sole task is to prevent drinking water from being polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>Inside the home, examine the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for drips or leakages. Examine below sinks to look for leaking pipes. Local plumber estimated rate of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ pleased I checked around. Under the sink, put a pail or pan below the drain, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe. To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
