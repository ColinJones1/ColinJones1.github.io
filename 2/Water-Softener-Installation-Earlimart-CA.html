<p>Water firmness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is because soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. Which's where the term hardness" originated from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>
<p>If your water heater has needed numerous repairs over the last couple of years, it may be time to get it replaced.

It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
