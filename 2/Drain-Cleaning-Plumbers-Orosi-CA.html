<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will accumulate in various parts of the plumbing system, most commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow issues and even stop a fixture from flowing entirely.

<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to get rid of the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals bring favorable charges, so water softeners utilize salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with safe and clean water, you are needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, potable and watering, you are likewise required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
