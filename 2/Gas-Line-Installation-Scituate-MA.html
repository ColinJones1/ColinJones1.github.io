<h3>Water Heater Leaking in Scituate MA? How to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps catch wetness and sediment so that they don't go into the control system. Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to remove any sediment. A sediment trap might be included in a drip leg install. The City needs backflow prevention devices to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that could enable tainted water into the City system or personal plumbing. These gadgets go through testing by a qualified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. Oftentimes, they go through routine tests later on, too.</p>
<p>While many water heater problems can be successfully fixed, some concerns will require total hot water heater replacement. If your hot water heater is past its normal life-span (usually anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless water heater) or if it has a major leak or comprehensive rust, it might be time to consider replacement.</p>
