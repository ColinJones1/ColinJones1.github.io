<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer coating of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
