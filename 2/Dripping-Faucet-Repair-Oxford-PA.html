Sometimes throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. A few of those thin spots leak right away and sometimes those leakages come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be appropriately re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
