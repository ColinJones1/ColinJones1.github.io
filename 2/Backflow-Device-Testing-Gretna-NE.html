<p>Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. A little round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer.
