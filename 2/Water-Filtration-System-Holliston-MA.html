<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>The irrigation backflow testing season is from May to September. Watering backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to guarantee correct backflow prevention remains in location to safeguard our drinking water during the watering season.
