<p>This is a completely legitimate concern that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, of course, as essential as your hot water heater, water line, or drains. Nonetheless, it includes a reasonable amount of performance to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a relatively small cylindrical device set up under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal unit takes down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; additional, more substantial costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for residents. A PE or RA can help determine if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
<p>Call a plumber: If the clog is not in the P-trap and water flows freely from the sink drain into your bucket, then it's time to call a plumber The clog is likely even more down the line. Leaking sewer lines inside your home can harm floors, carpentry, and other important objects such as cabinets. Left unattended, leaking sewer water can cause mold and far more severe structural damage. If overlooked, leaking sewer water from your main house drain or house sewer can also trigger extensive damage.</p>
