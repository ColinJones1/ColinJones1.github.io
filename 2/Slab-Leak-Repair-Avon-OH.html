Each and every installation ought to be taken a look at on an individual basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems includes the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are created to match the hazard that exists in the areas they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be extremely different, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be created and installed to fulfill that specific risk or need. An aircraft garage will need a really different fire security system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow defense requirements for these 2 examples would also vary greatly.</p>
