To make it soft, you need to remove the minerals. That's the main difference between tough and soft water The existence of the minerals in the water can show itself in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>Say you decide to go that route. The next concern is whether or not you can install it yourself. Put it this way, if you're a knowledgeable helpful individual, but you've never ever handled this specific repair, you can probably do it, providing you do your homework.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can attain this.</p>
