<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most home centers carry just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
