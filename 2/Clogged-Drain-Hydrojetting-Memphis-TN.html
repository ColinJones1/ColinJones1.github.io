<h3>Kitchen Faucet Repair in Memphis Tennessee</h2>
<p>The source or area of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main sewers traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Did You Know that if you are planning a house remodeling job and plan to repair, replace or add brand-new plumbing, you are required to secure a plumbing permit. In turn, if you are hiring a licensed plumbing company they too need to secure an authorization. A Plumbing permit will supply you with a security inspection; which will insure that the work was done according to code. It is not worth your household's safety and or monetary danger to avoid this very fundamental part of your job.</p>

If it fits, you can install the new disposal using the old flange.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the cause of the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
