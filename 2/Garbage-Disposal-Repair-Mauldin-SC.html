<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Mauldin SC?</h3>
<p>We are a licensed and insured  drain cleaning contractor who can clean out tough drain blockages and leave them working fresh again. The typical cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per direct foot. Total costs vary from $200 to $1,000 or more depending upon the length of piping required to connect to the main gas supply, which generally averages 30'.</p>
<p>A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP waste disposal unit unit can grind soft, non-fibrous foods. There is very little insulation in the weaker models. Here are some common kinds of garbage disposals you might want to think about. There are generally two types of disposals: aluminum and stainless steel. Aluminum disposals are the most cost-effective, costing about $70 to $150 a pop however are vulnerable to rust and leaking.</p>
<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were built prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental toxin (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>At least once every 3 months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper performance, and draining a gallon approximately assists remove the sediment. If you find a leak and opt for a patching task rather of a repiping job, simply bear in mind that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the same material and they may be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to think about repiping your whole house when you find a leak.</p>
