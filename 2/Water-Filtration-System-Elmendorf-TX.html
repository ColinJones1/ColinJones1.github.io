<p>Most softeners have a bypass developed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to supply some sort of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to preserve the system.</p>

These awesome additions to your tubs and sinks can reduce the amount of hair and food scraps that wind up in your drainpipes.
