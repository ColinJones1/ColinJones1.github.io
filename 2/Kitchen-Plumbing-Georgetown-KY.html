Prior to you begin the troubles of conventional pipe replacement, consider pipe lining. Repair damage from breaks, deterioration, and more, without needing to replace the whole pipe.

<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will eventually take its toll.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is normal in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
