A water softener addresses among the most terrible and widespread water problems: hard water.  Tough water wreaks havoc on the modern home.

The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health danger or health hazard conditions. They must be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet).
