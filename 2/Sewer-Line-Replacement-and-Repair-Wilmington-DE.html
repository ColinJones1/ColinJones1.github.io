<p>Visible smell. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the backyard, basement, or throughout your house or business area, offer us a call. That smell may be originating from your sewer system, which needs repair work right now. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and controls air pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will typically need to be changed rather than repaired.
