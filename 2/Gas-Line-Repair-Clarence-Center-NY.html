Indoor gas leaks from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning devices take place most commonly in the winter season.

If you haven't done so already, we recommend setting up carbon monoxide detectors beyond bed room doors to notify you of any possible gas leaks.</p>
<p>1. Install a hair-stopper - Hair-stoppers work simply as their name implies. They stop long hair from going into and obstructing your shower drain.
