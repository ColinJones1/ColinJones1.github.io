<h3>Getting Blocked Sewer Drainage Solutions at Amesbury MA</h3>
<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was often clogging. They came out and dug a brand-new path for the line connected it to the sewer and everything.

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
