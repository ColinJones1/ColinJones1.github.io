Liquified calcium and magnesium precipitate out of tough water as scale, which builds up on the insides of pipes, hot water heater, tea kettles, coffee makers and industrial equipment. Scale decreases circulation through pipes and is a bad conductor of heat. Eventually, pipes can become entirely clogged.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
