<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals bring favorable charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with safe and clean water, you are needed to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, potable and watering, you are also needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

If you have not done so already, we advise installing carbon monoxide gas detectors beyond bed room doors to notify you of any possible gas leaks.</p>
