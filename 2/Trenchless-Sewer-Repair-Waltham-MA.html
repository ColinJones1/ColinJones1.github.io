<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in areas where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

Copper has been the favored choice to replace galvanized iron pipes (which utilized to be thought about very strong, however they were found to break under pressure and tend to rust within a few years). Today, the majority of quality contractors utilize PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>When choosing the proper system protection there are several factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation ought to be looked at on a private basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire security system are developed to match the hazard that exists in the places they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be very various, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be developed and set up to fulfill that particular risk or need. An aircraft hangar will need a really various fire protection system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would also differ greatly.</p>
