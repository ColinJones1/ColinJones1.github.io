<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to avoid backflow. The basic methods of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow.

A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>You reside in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done quickly.

If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
