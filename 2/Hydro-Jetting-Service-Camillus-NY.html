<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to prevent backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow.

<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health danger if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, in addition to examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
