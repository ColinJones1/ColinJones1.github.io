<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.

<p>So, if you wish to stop needing to jerk your toilet deal with whenever you flush and are worn out and ill of posting polite signs in your bathroom everytime you have individuals over, get a brand-new trip lever that in fact works for your toilet.
