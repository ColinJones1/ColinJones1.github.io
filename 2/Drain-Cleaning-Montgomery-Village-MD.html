<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps catch moisture and sediment so that they don't go into the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to eliminate any sediment. A sediment trap might be consisted of in a drip leg install.

<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the building envelope including below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a system, fixture, or sub-system  group is replaced, a permit and inspection will not be needed. This will not prevent the licensee from acquiring authorizations and inspections for such work if so preferred.</p>
<p>If your water heater has required multiple repairs over the last couple of years, it might be time to get it replaced.

If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your water heater.</p>
