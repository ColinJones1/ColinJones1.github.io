That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>If there is backflow at your home, you could contaminate your drinking water with non-treated water from an irrigation canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it.

<p>Clamp the drain hose. The water softener requires to drain the depleted salt water option after the regeneration cycle. Secure the drain hose securely and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning drainage, all drain hose pipes should have an air space. The end of the hose be at least 2 inches above the dedicated drain. An air gap might be utilized to achieve this, and may be needed depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>
