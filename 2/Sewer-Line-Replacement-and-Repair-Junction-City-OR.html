<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Junction City OR</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leaks take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these issues.</p>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
