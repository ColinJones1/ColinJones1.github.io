<h3>Faucet Replacement in Wellsville Ohio</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 efforts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the recently cleaned up main drain.
