Current guidelines restrict the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We provide 2 types of water treatment systems for hard water: Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
