Based upon research carried out by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Advantages Study, 2011.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can try disposing a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and then turn on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food debris stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or tired, broken sink? No problem is too great for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our skilled plumbing team finishes the job quickly and affordably.</p>
