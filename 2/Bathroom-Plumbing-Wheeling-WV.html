A water softener addresses one of the most widespread and devastating water problems: difficult water.  Tough water wreaks havoc on the modern-day home. Scale develops in your pipes, clogging them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale significantly reduces the life expectancy of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice machines. Hard water ruins hot water home appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will strengthen and solidify into solid deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>
