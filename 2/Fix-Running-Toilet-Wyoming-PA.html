<p>Many cars have a metal line that runs the length of the vehicle with rubber fuel lines linking at either end, one at the fuel tank and the other to the engine.

Hard water triggers white or gray deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be utilized to lower these signs.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup could still take place.</p>
