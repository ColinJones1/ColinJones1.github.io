<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had actually supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of three attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his understanding and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the recently cleaned main drain.

While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
