Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe at Roxbury MA</h3>
<p>Examining the condition, water, and age lines to the water heater can assist plumbers comprehend many things, including water pressure and signs of leaks. If the hot water heater has been kept with annual flush service, it can likely last beyond its basic warranty. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to prospective contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>
