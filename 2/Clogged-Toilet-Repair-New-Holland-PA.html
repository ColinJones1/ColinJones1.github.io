If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous.

Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
