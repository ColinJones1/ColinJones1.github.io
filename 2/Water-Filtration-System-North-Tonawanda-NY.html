After the brand-new system is installed, we turn the water on and perform tests on the new system. Once the system passes our tests, it's good to opt for you.</p>

That means 8 less inches of hot water, not to point out the truth that your tap water is being heated in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling germs.</p>
